- Confirmation prompts with `-i` or force delete with `-f`
- Metadata stored for each deleted file

## Usage

```bash
trrrash file1.txt file2.sh      # Safely delete files
trrrash -f file.txt             # Force delete (no confirmation)
trrrash -i file.txt             # Interactive delete (ask before)
trrrash -b file.txt             # Restore by original name
trrrash -e                      # Empty the trash folder
